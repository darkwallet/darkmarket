We are not actively maintaining this project as we want to focus our efforts on developing base Bitcoin infrastructure before getting ahead of ourselves.
We developed this as a proof of concept during the Toronto hackathon to win the $20k first prize and show people the tech is totally doable for decentralised markets.
The code was strictly a prototype and nothing more.

If you have a fork, then send me a message and I'll it above.

Happy hacking!
